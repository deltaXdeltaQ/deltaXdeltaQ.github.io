I am a Sherman Fairchild postdoctoral fellow in the Walter Burke Institute for Theoretical Physics at Caltech, supervised by [John Preskill](http://theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/)

I received my Ph.D. in Quantum Science and Engineering from the University of Chicago in 2024, advised by [Liang Jiang](https://pme.uchicago.edu/faculty/liang-jiang). My thesis is [Towards Practical Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing](https://knowledge.uchicago.edu/record/12363?v=pdf). I obtained my B.S. in Physics from Nanjing University in 2019. 

My research interests center on quantum error correction and fault-tolerant quantum computing.
